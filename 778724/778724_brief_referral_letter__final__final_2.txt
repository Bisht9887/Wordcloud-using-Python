Today I spoke with this gentleman about possible surgical nonsurgical treatment.  He is scheduled to have an injection today I don't see any value in doing that because of the amount of arthritis he has.  He is done well with his right hip at this point and was scheduled for left hip arthroplasty direct anterior approach.  He was happy there discussion and all questions were answered.  I've asked him to see his primary care for an H&P preoperatively and he'll follow up 2 weeks postoperatively.
